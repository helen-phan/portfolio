## Hi! My name is Helen Phan

I'm a User Researcher.

After starting in the Product Management realm, I've fallen in love with asking the right questions, talking to users and utilizing my questioning skills in a professional setting. My experience is in healthcare, health tech, voiceover tech, and smarthome technologies. I'm very open to expanding my world and learning about new industries.

Outside of work, I love to walk, attend improv shows, and figure out how to recreate that dish I had at that restaurant (albeit extremely poorly). I'm always ready to discuss all things transit, food history, and anything and everything in between. 

You can find me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/helenphan24).
