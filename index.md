## Hi! My name is Helen Phan

I'm a User Researcher.

After starting in the product management realm, I've fallen in love with asking the right questions, talking to users and utilizing my questioning skills. My experience is in healthcare, health tech, voiceover tech, and smarthome technologies. I'm very open to expanding my world and learning about new industries.

Outside of work, I love to walk, attend improv shows, and figure out how to recreate that dish I had at that restaurant (albeit extremely poorly). I'm always ready to discuss all things transit, food history, and anything and everything in between. 

You can find me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/helenphan24).
